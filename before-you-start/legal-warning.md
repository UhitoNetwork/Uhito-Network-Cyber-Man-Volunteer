**Sharing cybersecurity information can be dangerous if you don't know the laws.**

### What Can Get You in Trouble

- **Sharing hacking tools** – Even explaining how to use them can be illegal in some countries.
- **Giving advice beyond your certification** – If someone follows your advice and gets hacked, you could be sued.
- **Accessing systems without permission** – Even if you're "just testing," it's a crime.
- **Posting sensitive information** – Don't share real names, passwords, or personal data of people you help.

### Before You Do Anything

1. **Know your local laws** – Research computer crime laws in your country.
2. **Stay within your certified knowledge** – If you're not certified, only help family and close friends privately.
