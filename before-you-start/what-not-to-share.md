# What Not to Share – Even to Help

### Never Share These

❌ **Hacking tools or scripts** – Download links, code that attacks systems, or step‑by‑step hacking guides.

❌ **Personal information of victims** – Names, addresses, phone numbers, or account details of people you helped.

❌ **Unauthorized access methods** – How to bypass security, crack passwords, or exploit vulnerabilities.

❌ **Anything you're not certified to teach** – If you don't have a certificate in that area, don't give public advice.

❌ **Screenshots with sensitive data** – Blur or remove any personal information before sharing.

### Why?

- It could be illegal in your country.
- It could be used by bad actors.
- It could get you sued or arrested.
- It breaks the trust of the people you're trying to help.

**When in doubt, leave it out.**
