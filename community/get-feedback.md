# Get Feedback on Your Work

Before you publish or run a workshop, it's wise to get a second opinion.

---

### How to Get Feedback

1. **Ask a trusted friend** – Someone who understands your goals.
2. **Share in our community** – Email us at uhitonetwork@gmail.com with your draft materials.
3. **Test with a small audience** – Run your workshop with 2–3 people first and ask for honest feedback.

### What to Ask For
- Is this clear and simple?
- Did I stay within my certified knowledge?
- Is anything missing?
- Could this be misunderstood?

### Feedback Is a Gift

Don't be afraid of criticism. It helps you improve and avoid mistakes. Every Cyber-Man started somewhere.

**Keep learning, keep improving.**
