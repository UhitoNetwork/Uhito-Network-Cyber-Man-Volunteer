# Creating Awareness Materials

As a Cyber-Man, you'll create content to warn and teach your community.

### Types of Materials You Can Make
- **Posters** – One simple message, big text, easy to read
- **Social media posts** – Short, clear warnings
- **Checklists** – Step‑by‑step actions people can take
- **Short videos** – 1‑minute explainers (talking head or screen recording)
- **Workshop slides** – Simple presentations with pictures

### Where to Get Ideas
- Read the `warnings/` and `guides/` in our Awareness Repository
- Look at current scams in your area
- Ask people what confuses them

### Keep It Simple
- No jargon
- One main message per piece
- Use examples and stories
