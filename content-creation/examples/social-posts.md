## Post 1: 2FA Reminder
**Text:**  
Two‑step verification (2FA) is the single best way to protect your accounts.  
It means even if someone steals your password, they can't get in without the second step – usually a code from your phone.  
Turn it on today. It takes 2 minutes.

Got a message that says "your account will be closed" or "you won a prize"?  
Stop. Don't click.

Always go directly to the official website – don't use the link in the message.

## Post 3: Password Tips
**Text:**  
One password for everything? That's like one key for your house, car, and office – if someone copies it, they have everything.  
Use a password manager and create strong, unique passwords for each account.  
It's easier than you think.

## Post 4: SIM Swap Warning
**Text:**  
Did you know thieves can steal your phone number?  
They trick your phone company into moving your number to a SIM they control – then they break into your accounts.  
Protect yourself:  
- Add a PIN to your phone account  
- Use an authenticator app, not SMS, for 2FA  
- If your phone suddenly loses signal, call your bank immediately.
