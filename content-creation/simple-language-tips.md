# Tips for Writing in Simple Language

### Rule 1: Use Everyday Words
| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| two‑factor authentication | "a second step to prove it's you" |
| phishing | "fake messages that steal your info" |
| malware | "bad software that harms your device" |
| ransomware | "software that locks your files and asks for money" |

### Rule 2: Keep Sentences Short
- One idea per sentence.
- 15–20 words max.

### Rule 3: Tell Them What to Do
- "Turn on this setting."
- "Never click that link."
- "Call your bank if you see this."

### Rule 4: Use Examples
- "If you get a message like this: 'Your account will be closed' – it's a scam."
- "Example: someone calls saying they're from Microsoft – hang up."

### Rule 5: Test It
Read your material to someone who knows nothing about tech. If they understand, you're good.
