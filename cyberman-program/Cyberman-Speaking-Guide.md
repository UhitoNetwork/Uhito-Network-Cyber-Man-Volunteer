**Welcome, Cyberman.**

People hear us. But do they understand us?

This is the only question that matters.

You can have all the certificates. You can know every hacker trick. You can follow every ethics rule.

But if people only *hear* you and do not *understand* you—you have failed.

This guide exists to make sure that never happens.

---

## The Problem We Solve

> *"The people hear us what we say but not understand what we say."*

This is not their fault. This is our speaking problem.

Tech people speak one language. Normal people speak another.

The hacker counts on this gap. They know that if warnings sound like noise, people will ignore them—until it's too late.

**You are here to close the gap.**

---

## The One Rule

> **If they don't understand, it's your speaking. Not their intelligence.**

Repeat this until it hurts.

Every time someone's eyes glaze over, every time they nod but later do the wrong thing—that is on you.

Fix your speaking. Not them.

## The Four Laws of Speaking

### Law 1: Kill Every Jargon Word

Jargon is the wall between you and them. Tear it down.

| Jargon | Translation |
| :----- | :---------- |
| Multi-factor authentication | Second lock |
| Phishing | A trap message |
| Malware | Bad software that breaks things |
| Vulnerability | A hole hackers can crawl through |
| Encryption | Scrambling so only you can read it |
| Patch | Fix |
| Zero-day | A hole even the makers don't know about |
| Social engineering | Tricking you, not your computer |

**Test:** If your grandmother wouldn't say it, change it.

---

### Law 2: Find What Hurts

People do not care about "threat vectors." They care about:
- Losing money
- Embarrassing photos leaking
- Their identity stolen
- Their accounts hacked
- Their family scammed

Every technical fact has a **human hurt**. Find it. Lead with it.

| Technical Fact | Human Hurt |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Data breach at bank | Your savings could be drained |
| New phone vulnerability | Someone can read your private messages |
| Wi-Fi spoofing at airport | That free Wi-Fi might steal your passwords |
| AI voice cloning | Scammers can sound exactly like your grandson |

**Lead with the hurt. Then explain the how.**

---

### Law 3: Tell a Story

Facts are forgotten. Stories are repeated.

**Don't say:**
> "Smishing attacks increased 300% this year."

**Say:**
> "Last week, Maria got a text from her 'bank.' It said her account would close if she didn't click. She almost did—but she called first. It was a scammer. She saved her money by waiting."

**Stories make people remember. Stories make people act.**

---

### Law 4: One Thing Only

Never give a list. Never give ten steps.

Give **one thing**.

| Danger | One Action |
| :----- | :--------- |
| Suspicious text | Stop. Call the person directly. Don't reply. |
| Weird email from friend | Message them on another app to check. |
| Unknown USB stick | Don't plug it in. Throw it away. |
| Password leaked | Change it now. Use a different one for every site. |

**One clear action saves people. Confusion kills.**

## The Speaker's Process

When you learn something new from `research` or `study`:

### Step 1: Understand It Yourself
If you don't get it, stop. Learn more. Ethics first.

### Step 2: Find the Core Danger
Ask: **What is the one thing that hurts people here?**

### Step 3: Find the Human Story
Ask: **Who does this happen to? How would they feel?**

### Step 4: Strip the Tech
Ask every word: **Would a normal person say this?**

### Step 5: End with One Action
Ask: **What is the one thing they must do?**

## Speaking Examples

### From Research to Warning

**Research says:**
> "Attackers exploit CVE-2025-1234, a remote code execution vulnerability in unpatched Android systems via malicious MMS."

**Cyberman says:**
> "Hackers can break into your phone with just a text message. If you get a weird text with strange symbols, delete it. And turn on automatic updates—that closes the hole."

**Why it works:**
- No jargon
- Shows the danger (break into your phone)
- Gives one action (delete it + turn on updates)

---

### From Study to Lesson

**Study says:**
> "Social engineering manipulates psychological principles like authority and urgency to bypass technical controls."

**Cyberman says:**
> "Scammers don't always hack your computer—they hack your trust. They'll pretend to be your boss or send a message saying 'URGENT: Pay now!' They want you to panic. So when someone pushes you to act fast, stop. Call them. Check first."

**Why it works:**
- Relatable (pretend to be boss, urgent message)
- Human emotion (panic)
- One action (stop, call, check)

## Common Speaking Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
| :------ | :----------- | :-- |
| "Use strong passwords" | Vague | "Use three random words like 'purple-turtle-bicycle'" |
| "Be careful online" | Empty | "Before clicking a link in email, hover over it. If the address looks wrong, don't click." |
| "That's phishing" | Jargon | "That message is a trap. They want your password." |
| Ten tips at once | Overwhelming | One tip. Next week, another. |
| Only scaring | Freezes people | "This is scary, but here's exactly what protects you..." |

## The Speaker's Checklist

Before you share anything:

- [ ] Did I remove every technical word?
- [ ] Would my mother understand this?
- [ ] Did I lead with what matters to *them*?
- [ ] Did I tell a story or give an example?
- [ ] Do they know exactly **one thing** to do?
- [ ] Am I staying within my certified knowledge?

If all are **yes**, share it.

If any are **no**, fix it.

---

## Your First Speaking Task

1. Go to `research`
2. Find one small threat
3. Write a 3‑sentence warning for `awareness`
4. Post it in `vulunteer`

**Format:**

> **What's the danger:** [One simple sentence]  
> **How it happens:** [Short story or example]  
> **What to do:** [One clear action]

---

## The Promise You Make

> *"I will not let people just hear me.  
> I will make them understand me.  
> I will translate everything.  
> I will speak so simply that no one can pretend they didn't know.  
> This is my job. This is who I am."*
