# Cyber-Man Ethics Reminder

### The Core Rules

1. **Certification First** – Never help publicly beyond your certified knowledge.
2. **Legal Always** – Break no laws, even to help.
3. **Transparency** – Be clear about your qualifications.
4. **Safety Focus** – Protect, don't show off technical skills.
5. **Community Trust** – Earn it through consistent, safe help.

### Daily Check
- Am I staying within my certified limits?
- Is this action legal and authorized?
- Will this make people safer or just show what I know?
- Am I being transparent about what I can and cannot do?

### The Cyber-Man Promise
> "I use my certified knowledge only for protection.
> I speak simply so everyone understands.
> I follow laws even when inconvenient.
> I protect community trust as carefully as I protect data."
