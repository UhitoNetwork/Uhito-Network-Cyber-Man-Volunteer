# Cyber-Man Responsibility

### You Are Responsible for What You Share

Every Cyber-Man must understand:
- **You choose what to post** – Uhito Network provides guidance, but you make the final decision.
- **You face the consequences** – If you share something illegal or harmful, it's on you.
- **You must know your limits** – Never give advice beyond your certified knowledge.
- **You must protect privacy** – Don't share personal information about people you help.

### Before You Post Anything, Ask Yourself:
- Is this legal in my country?
- Am I qualified to give this advice?
- Could this be misunderstood or misused?
- Would I be comfortable explaining this to a judge?

If you're unsure, **stop and ask** – email us at uhitonetwork@gmail.com.
