# Why Cyber-Men Volunteer

### Benefits of Volunteering

1. **Discover Your Abilities**  
   When you create awareness content, you learn what you really know and what you still need to study.

2. **Build Skills Employers Want**  
   Companies look for people who can communicate simply, act ethically, and help others. Volunteering proves you can do all three.

3. **Show Ethics in Action**  
   A certificate says you passed a test. Volunteer work says you used your knowledge to help people – that's real ethics.

4. **Increase Your Chance to Get Hired**  
   Your LinkedIn profile will show real work, real impact, and real responsibility. Employers notice that.

5. **Protect Your Community**  
   People in your area need simple warnings. You can be the one who helps them avoid scams.
