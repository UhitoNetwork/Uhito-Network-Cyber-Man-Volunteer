# Why Document Your Volunteer Work

### Without Documentation, You're Invisible

If you help people but never write it down:
- No one knows what you did
- You can't prove your skills
- You have nothing to show employers
- You might forget what you learned

### With Documentation, You Have:

1. **Proof of your abilities** – "I helped 10 people set up 2FA" is a real achievement.
2. **Material for your portfolio** – You can show examples of your work.
3. **Evidence of your ethics** – Employers see you used your skills to help, not harm.
4. **A record of your growth** – Look back and see how far you've come.
5. **Legal protection** – If someone questions your actions, you have records.
