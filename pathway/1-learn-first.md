# Step 1: Learn First

Before you can help others, you must learn.

### What to Learn
- Cybersecurity fundamentals (threats, defenses, basic tools)
- How to explain things simply
- Your local laws about cybersecurity and privacy

### Where to Learn (Free)
- **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** (Coursera – financial aid)
- **Cisco Networking Academy** – free courses
- **TryHackMe** – free beginner rooms
- **Our Study Repository** – https://github.com/UhitoNetwork/study-repo

### Get at Least One Basic Certificate
- Google IT Support or Cybersecurity certificate
- Cisco Introduction to Cybersecurity
- CompTIA Security+ (if you can afford the exam)

**Do not give public advice until you have a certificate.** Help only family and close friends privately while you learn.
