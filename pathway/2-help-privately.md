# Step 2: Help Privately

While you're learning, you can help people close to you – but **privately**.

### Who You Can Help
- Family members
- Close friends
- Neighbors you know personally

### What You Can Do
- Warn them about common scams (using simple language)
- Help them turn on 2FA
- Show them how to spot phishing messages
- Help them create stronger passwords

### What You Must NOT Do
- Access their accounts for them (let them do it, you guide)
- Give advice beyond what you've learned
- Share their personal information anywhere
- Post about it publicly

### Document Privately
Keep a private note of what you did, what worked, and what you learned. This will help you later when you build your portfolio.
