# Step 4: Serve as a Cyber-Man

Once you have certification and experience helping privately, you're ready to serve your community publicly.

### What You Can Now Do
- Create awareness content (posters, social media posts, short videos)
- Run small workshops at local community centers, libraries, or mosques
- Share simple warnings with your wider community
- Build a portfolio of your work

### Always Remember
- Stay within your certified knowledge.
- Never share hacking tools or methods.
- Document everything.
- Take responsibility for what you post.

### Start Small
- Post one simple tip on your personal social media.
- Print a few checklists and give them to neighbours.
- Offer a free 30‑minute talk at a local school.

**Every small action builds your experience and your reputation.**
