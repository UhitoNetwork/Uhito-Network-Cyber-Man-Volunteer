# Highlighting Ethics in Your Portfolio

Employers don't just want technical skills – they want people they can trust.

---

### Why Ethics Matter

- Cybersecurity is about trust. Companies hire people who won't misuse their access.
- Showing that you volunteered to help your community proves you have strong ethics.
- It separates you from candidates who only learned to hack.

### How to Show Ethics in Your Portfolio

**In your LinkedIn summary:**
> "I believe that cybersecurity skills should be used to protect, not harm. That's why I volunteer with Uhito Network's Cyber-Man Program, creating simple awareness materials for my community."

**In your impact stories:**
> "I made sure to stay within my certified knowledge and never gave advice I wasn't qualified to give."

**In interviews:**
> "When I volunteer, I always document my work and follow strict ethical guidelines. I know the legal boundaries and respect them."

### Ethics Are Your Advantage

Many candidates have certificates. Few can show they used their knowledge ethically to help others. This is your edge.

**Always lead with ethics. It's what makes a true Cyber-Man.**
