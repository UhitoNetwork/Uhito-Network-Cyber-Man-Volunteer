# How to Show Your Work (Without Sharing Private Info)

You've done great work – now let the world see it (safely).

---

### What You Can Share Publicly

✅ Anonymised impact stories (no real names, no personal details)  
✅ Examples of materials you created (posters, posts)  
✅ Screenshots of your activity log (with private info removed)  
✅ Statistics: "Helped 15 people set up 2FA"  
✅ Testimonials (with permission, and only first name or initial)

---

### What You Should NOT Share Publicly

❌ Real names, addresses, phone numbers of people you helped  
❌ Screenshots containing personal data  
❌ Hacking tools or methods  
❌ Anything that could identify a victim

---

### Create a Portfolio Document

You can create a simple PDF portfolio with:
- Your story (who you are, why you volunteer)
- Examples of your work (anonymised)
- Impact stories
- Skills you've developed
- Links to your LinkedIn and contact email (optional)

---

### Share on LinkedIn, Personal Website, or GitHub

Use your portfolio when applying for jobs. It sets you apart from candidates who only have certificates.

**Remember: Your work proves your value. Show it proudly, but always protect privacy.**
