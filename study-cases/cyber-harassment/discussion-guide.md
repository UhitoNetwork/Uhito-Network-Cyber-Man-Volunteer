| A friend mentions suicide | Stay on call, get help, don't leave | Act hopeless |
| A parent asks what to watch for | Explain red flags simply | Ask questions |
| Someone says "I sent photos and now they're blackmailing me" | Don't blame, document, report | Act ashamed |

### 📢 Awareness Message Creation

As a team, create ONE simple message about this story that you could share:

- On social media
