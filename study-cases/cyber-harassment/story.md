# 💀 Suicide

## 📖 The Story

Cyber attacks can play their part in destroying lives. Law enforcement agencies try to stop them.

**🦸 Uhito** works as a **Cyber Team Leader** with the police. He leads a unit that tracks cyber criminals.

One day, Uhito went into a chat conversation and saw someone offering his services. The name was Vladimir, and his service was social communication — he would contact victims and destroy their lives through manipulation and threats.

Uhito gave him a fake name and told him: *"I'll pay you if you threaten me."*

But Vladimir replied: *"I'm in the middle of a process with another victim. There is little time to finish it."*

### 👮 The Investigation

Uhito gathered his **cyber crime team** at the police station and started giving tasks:

*"Track Vladimir's location using the conversation. Find where he is operating from."*

One of the team members accessed Vladimir's computer remotely. What he saw stopped him cold.

Vladimir was talking to a teenage girl. He had her secrets. He was threatening to expose everything to her family, her friends, her beloved. The girl was terrified. In the messages, she said she wanted to throw herself off the roof.

Uhito's team worked quickly to locate her. They found her building. They rushed.

⏰ But the time had passed.

💔 She jumped. She committed suicide.

### 😔 The Promise

Uhito sat in silence. Then he said: *"If we took less time, we would have helped her."*

He vowed to avenge her.

### 🎯 The Trap

To draw Vladimir out, Uhito sent him money with police approval. He told him: *"Do the job. I'm ready for the consequences."*

Vladimir sent a welcome message. He tested Uhito's patience. Then the threats came:

*"I'll kill someone from your family if you don't back off."*

He sent a picture of himself — confident, mocking, untouchable.

Vladimir threatened again and again. But each time he talked, Uhito's team got closer.

They finally located him.

🚔 Police special forces surrounded his building from all sides. But Vladimir was fast. He ran across the roofs and escaped. The net failed.

---

### 🔫 The Confrontation

Vladimir was toppled. His operations were exposed. He wanted revenge.

He went to kill Uhito.

He found him in the middle of a crowd and opened fire.

Uhito was hit in the right hand. He dropped to one knee. He heard the gunfire, saw where it came from, and returned fire with his other hand.

🚓 Police backup arrived moments later. Vladimir was caught.

---

### 🕊️ Aftermath

**Uhito survived. But he made his promise.**

He carries that girl in his memory. Every case, every threat, every criminal — he works faster now. For her.

---

**🦸 The hero is Uhito, Cyber Team Leader.**
