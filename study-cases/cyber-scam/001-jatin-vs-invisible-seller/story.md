# 🛡️ Jatin's Friend vs The Invisible Seller

## 📖 The Story

Jatin is an Indian man living with his family. One day, his friend came to him with a problem.

His friend wanted to buy a second-hand mobile phone. He found a seller online, agreed on a price, and made the payment. But the seller never showed up.

### 🏦 Where He Went for Help

First, he went to the bank. He explained everything and asked if they could stop the payment or get his money back.

The bank chief services said: *"The payment is already done. We can do nothing."*

Next, he went to the police station. He filed a report and hoped they would track the seller.

The police replied: *"We can't help in this case. We have no way to follow that seller."*

### 🤝 Jatin Calls a Cyber Man

Jatin felt hopeless for his friend. Then he remembered someone — an old friend with computer knowledge. A **Cyber Man**.

He opened Messenger and sent a message.

The Cyber Man replied quickly: *"Anything for you, brother. Tell me what you need."*

Jatin explained everything: the payment, the bank, the police, the silence.

---

### 🧠 The First Ideas

The Cyber Man thought:

*"If we act fast, maybe the bank can block the money."*

But Jatin said: *"Too late. Already tried."*

*"What about police?"*

Jatin said: *"They said no. No line to follow."*

The Cyber Man felt stuck. Both doors were closed.

He told Jatin: *"Calm down, brother. Call me when you can."*

---

### 📞 The Call That Changed Everything

When Jatin called, he was crying. His friend lost money. Banks failed. Police failed. There was no hope.

The Cyber Man listened. He felt sad too.

But in that moment, something clicked.

He asked: *"How did your friend contact the seller? Messenger or phone call?"*

Jatin wiped his tears: *"Phone call."*

*"Which SIM card did he use?"*

*"Reliance Jio."*

---

### 💡 The Way Forward

The Cyber Man's mind started working.

*"Go to the Jio office. Take the police complaint with you. Ask for the call record of that number."*

Jatin felt hope for the first time.

But then the Cyber Man paused.

*"Wait. What if the police officer handling this case knows the seller? What if they're friends? What if he warns him?"*

He gave a better instruction:

> *"Make a copy of the call record first. Keep the original safe in your hands. Then give a copy to the police. Let them backtrack and find the seller's real ID. Once you have his name, open a case. Let the judge decide. That's how you get justice."*

### 🦸 The Hero

Jatin's friend had a way forward.

Not from the bank.  
Not from the police.  
But from a friend who knew what to do.

**The helper: Cyber Man.**
